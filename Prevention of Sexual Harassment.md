## 2. What would you do in case you face or witness any incident or repeated incidents of such behaviour?

* Follow your company’s procedures (if they exist). This demonstrates that you took the steps your employers deemed necessary to make them aware of the harassment. You may also want to consider writing a detailed account of your harassment and sharing it with human resources or other supervisors in an email, which will serve as a date and time record. This ensures that you convey all relevant details and establishes that your employer was made aware of the harassment.
* Talk to a lawyer. Even if you don’t want to file a lawsuit, it may be useful to talk to a lawyer who specializes in employment law to help you better understand your options. Consultations are confidential and many organizations offer financial aid. To find a lawyer, contact the National Employment Lawyer’s Association, Legal Aid at Work or the Time’s Up Legal Defense Fund.
