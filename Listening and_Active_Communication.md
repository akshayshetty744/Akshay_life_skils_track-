## How can you make your communication assertive? You can analyse the videos and then think what steps you can apply in your own life? (Watch the videos first before answering this question.)

- One of your close friends has a crush on your roommate, and your roommate seems to have some interest in them. Lately, when you make plans with either of them, they always ask if the other will be there (which you find just a little irritating).
- Use 'I' statements. Using I statements lets others know what you're thinking or feeling without sounding accusatory. For instance, say, "I disagree," rather than, "You're wrong." If you have a request, say, "I would like you to help with this" rather than, "You need to do this." Keep your requests simple, specific and clear.
- Use body language. Communication isn't just verbal. Act confident even if you aren't feeling it. Keep an upright posture, but lean forward a bit. Make regular eye contact. Maintain a neutral or positive facial expression. Don't cross your arms or legs. Face the person. Practice assertive body language in front of a mirror or with a friend or colleague. In addition to what you say, your body language and facial expressions are also important.
- Your boss has mentioned a large, upcoming project several times, saying they want you to work on it since it’s for clients you’ve assisted before.
