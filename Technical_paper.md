# OOP's & SOLID

1) Object-oriented programming (OOP) is a programming paradigm fundamental to many programming languages, OOPs, help in creating a working method and variable that can be reused without compromising on security. The emphasis of OOPs concepts is on data rather than on functions and is mainly used in different object-oriented programming languages such as Java, C#, C++, java,javascipt

2) In software development, Object-Oriented Design plays a crucial role when it comes to writing flexible, scalable, maintainable, and reusable code. There are so many benefits of using OOD but every developer should also have the knowledge of the SOLID principle for good object-oriented design in programming. The SOLID principle was introduced by Robert C. Martin, also known as Uncle Bob and it is a coding standard in programming

## Points to Keep in Mind

* **Write in your own words and code**
* Minimum 500 words
* Document all reference links that you have used
* Basic English punctuation is extremely important
* Use a grammar checker like Grammarly
* Use capitalization for the first character of the sentence and proper nouns.
* Use space after comma and full stop.
* Push on Github/Gitlab. Make sure the repo is public.

## Markdown Instructions
* Do not use blockquotes(>) at all
* Do not use italics at all
* Use headers ( # or ## or ### and so on)
* Use bullet points (*) or numbered points (1.)

## References Section
* Make sure references section is in bullet points
* Make sure references sections has proper external links

## Recommended Steps
For preparing technical paper:
1. Search on Google/Youtube
2. Read the articles/Watch videos
3. Compile a list of all the resources you used (This goes in the References section)
4. Write a few key points. Add more explanation/code samples/images as appropriate

## Assignment

* Submit a public Github/Gitlab URL link. It should be a markdown(.md) file.
* Submissions with grammar and spelling mistakes will not be accepted.
* Submissions with poor formatting will not be accepted.
* Submissions without a proper references section at the bottom will not be accepted.
