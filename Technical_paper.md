# OOP's & SOLID

1) Object-oriented programming (OOP) is a programming paradigm fundamental to many programming languages, OOPs, help in creating a working method and variable that can be reused without compromising on security. The emphasis of OOPs concepts is on data rather than on functions and is mainly used in different object-oriented programming languages such as Java, C#, C++, java,javascipt 
* Class
* Object
* Abstraction
* Encapsulation
* Inheritance
* Polymorphism

2) In software development, Object-Oriented Design plays a crucial role when it comes to writing flexible, scalable, maintainable, and reusable code. There are so many benefits of using OOD but every developer should also have the knowledge of the SOLID principle for good object-oriented design in programming. The SOLID principle was introduced by Robert C. Martin, also known as Uncle Bob and it is a coding standard in programming

* Single Responsibility Principle (SRP)
* Open/Closed Principle
* Liskov’s Substitution Principle (LSP)
* Interface Segregation Principle (ISP)
* Dependency Inversion Principle (DIP)



## Examples : 
1) Class 
* Classes were introduced in EcmaScript 2015 (ES6) to provide a cleaner way to follow object-oriented programming patterns. In terms of OOP, we often call classes as a ‘blueprint’ of an object

2) Inheritance
* Inheritance enables you to define a class that takes all the functionality from a parent class and allows you to add more. Using class inheritance, a class can inherit all the methods and properties of another class. Inheritance is a useful feature that allows code reusability.

3) Abstraction
* Abstraction hides certain details and only show the essential features of the object. It tries to reduce and factor out details so that the developer can focus on a  few concepts at a time. This approach improves understandability as well as maintainability of the code. Abstraction helps us to reduce code duplication.

4) Polymorphism 
* Polymorphism is the presentation of one interface for multiple data types. Let's say we have an Animal class that implements the talk method. If class Dog and Cat inherit talk() from class Animal, object dog and object cat both will talk but in a different form.

## Recommended Steps
For preparing technical paper:
1. Search on Google/Youtube
2. Read the articles/Watch videos
3. Compile a list of all the resources you used (This goes in the References section)
4. Write a few key points. Add more explanation/code samples/images as appropriate
